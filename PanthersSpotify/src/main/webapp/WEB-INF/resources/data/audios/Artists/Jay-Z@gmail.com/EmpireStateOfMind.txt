Yeah <br>
Yeah, I'm up at Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca <br> 
Right next to DeNiro, but I'll be hood forever<br>
I'm the new Sinatra and since I made it here<br>
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere<br>
I used to cop in Harlem, all of my Dominicanos<br>
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's<br>
Took it to my stash spot: 560 State Street<br>
Catch me in the kitchen like the Simmons whippin' pastry<br>
Cruising down 8th Street, off-white Lexus<br>
Driving so slow, but B.K. is from Texas<br>
Now I'm up at Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie<br>
Now I live on billboard and I brought my boys with me<br>
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais<br>
Sittin' courtside Knicks and Nets give me high fives<br>
Nigga I be spiked out, I can trip a referee<br>
Tell by my attitude that I most definitely from<br>

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game<br>
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can<br>
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though<br>
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though<br>
Welcome to the melting pot, corners where we selling rock<br>
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop<br>
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back<br>
For foreigners it ain't fair they act like they forgot how to add<br>
Eight million stories out there in the naked<br>
City it's a pity half of y'all won't make it<br>
Me I gotta plug Special Ed "I got it made"<br>
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwayne Wade<br>
Three-dice Cee-lo, three-card Monte<br>
Labor Day parade, rest in peace Bob Marley<br>
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade<br>
Long live the king, yo, I'm from the Empire State that's<br>

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders<br>
Or they can step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is<br>
Lined with casualties who sipping life casually<br>
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple Eve<br>
Caught up in the in-crowd<br>
Now you're in-style, and in the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out<br>
The city of sin is a pity on a whim<br>
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them<br>
Mommy took a bus trip, now she got her bust out<br>
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route<br>
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin<br>
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church ends<br>
Came here for school, graduated to the high life<br>
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight<br>
MDMA got you feeling like a champion<br>
The city never sleeps, better slip you an Ambien<br>
