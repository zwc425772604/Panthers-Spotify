I got enemies, got a lotta enemies<br>
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of my energy<br>
They tryna take the wave from a nigga<br>
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga<br>
<br>
I got girls in real life tryna fuck up my day<br>
Fuck goin' online that ain't part of my day<br>

Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy<br>
They tryna take the wave from a nigga<br>
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga<br>

I bought this one a house, I bought this one a mall<br>
I keep buyin' shit just make sure you keep track of it all<br>
I got bitches askin' me about the code for the Wi-Fi<br>
So they can talk about they timeline<br>
And show me pictures of they friends<br>
Just to tell me they ain't really friends<br>
Ex-girl she the female version of me<br>
I got strippers in my life, but they virgins to me<br>
I heard everybody talking bout what they gonna be<br>
I got high hopes for you niggas, we gon' see<br>
I got money in the courts so all my niggas are free<br>
Bout to call your ass a Uber, I got somewhere to be<br>
I hear fairy tales 'bout how they gon' run up on me<br>
Well run up when you see me then and we gon' see<br>
<br>
I got enemies, got a lotta enemies<br>
Got a lotta people tryna drain me of this energy<br>
They tryna take the wave from a nigga<br>
Fuckin' with the kid and pray for your nigga<br>
<br>
Naw, fuck all of you niggas I ain't finished<br>

Y'all don't wanna see wayne win 50 award<br>
I got real ones livin' past Kennedy Road<br>
I got real ones with me everywhere that I go<br>
