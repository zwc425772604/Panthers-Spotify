You used to call me on my<br>
You used to, you used to<br>
Yeah<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
Call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
And I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
Ever since I left the city,<br>
You got a reputation for yourself now<br>
Everybody knows and I feel left out<br>
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out<br>
'Cause ever since I left the city,<br>
you started wearing less and goin' out more<br>
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor<br>
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
Call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you<br>
You and me we just don't get along<br>
You make me feel like I did you wrong<br>
Going places where you don't belong<br>
Ever since I left the city,<br>
you, you got exactly what you asked for<br>
Running out of pages in your passport<br>
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
Call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
And I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
These days, all I do is<br>
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else<br>
Wonder if you're rollin' up a backwoods for someone else<br>
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else<br>
You don't need no one else<br>
You don't need nobody else, no<br>
Why you never alone<br>
Why you always touching road<br>
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl<br>
You was in a zone, yeah<br>
You should just be yourself<br>
Right now, you're someone else<br>
You used to call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
Call me on my cell phone<br>
Late night when you need my love<br>
And I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
I know when that hotline bling<br>
That can only mean one thing<br>
Ever since I left the city<br>
