FIRE:

Remember that night,
Under those stars, when they aligned?
My head and my heart both realized for
The very first time
Just how beautiful you truly are… oh you are…

Girl, you’re so fire,
The way that you walk and the things that you talk about.
I’m digging your style, I love how you do it 
You’re just so damn cute I cannot contain my desire
Oh it’s true, I’m a fool for you. 

I cannot deny,
The feelings of love,
Your presence provides.
This feels like the start of something so right
But we’ll never know, never know,
Until we give it our best try.. oh oh…

Girl, you’re so fire
The way that you walk and the things that you talk about
I’m digging your style 
I love how you do it
You’re just so damn cute I cannot contain my desire
Oh its true.. I’m a fool for you.

Girl, you fit like a glove 
These feelings of love won’t expire
You keep lighting me up. My need for your touch is so dire.
You can make stars rearrange I’m amazed by the change you inspire…

Girl, you’re so fire
The way that you walk and the things that you talk about.
I’m digging your style. I love how you do it. You’re just so damn cute I cannot contain my desire. Oh it’s true.. I’m a fool for you.
