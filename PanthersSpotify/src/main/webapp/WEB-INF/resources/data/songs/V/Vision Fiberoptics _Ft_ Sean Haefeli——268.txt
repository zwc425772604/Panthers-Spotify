View so clear, vision fiber-optic
At the crucible, just before my prime hits
Too smooth, and I'm not even trying yet
Walk the line, no cash, just appear rich
Voice boom like the crack from a thunder stick
Play it tough 'cause I'm just too fuckin' sensitive
Think I'm open, it's likely 'cause I smoked a spliff
No fun, but the silence feels like innocence
I see myself so clearly
Keep it moving, keep it going strong
Try to stand clear, but it move too fast
In the mood, but you know it won't last
She'll walk away with your heart and your cash
So sexy, but not enough class
Sounds stupid, but I put myself on blast
I was in the crib, she was grazing in the grass
Seems like the world was really just a flash
Keep it in perspective as I raise another glass
I see myself so clearly
Keep it moving, keep it going strong
Push it high speed, push to the cusp
Pop a few of these, make your head rush
I'm at capacity, waiting to erupt
Break free, will it ever be enough
I know the feel up and down just from a touch
So good, but I don't want to get stuck
Crushed paper, who can I trust
All world, rise from the dust
I see myself so clearly
Keep it moving, keep it going strong
